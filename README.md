Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.I used the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.

My  report should include each of the following:
